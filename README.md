This Project was completely made on Microsoft Excel, i.e, normalization and blending of dataset, followed by visualization using pivot tables

Problem statement :

Some Bank is a legacy financial institution headquartered in Hyderabad. They want to introduce a new line of credit cards, aiming to broaden its product offerings and reach in the financial market. Our company came to know about this through an internal link and approached Mitron Bank with a proposal to implement this project. However, strategy director of Mitron Bank, Mr.Bashnir Rover is skeptical and asked them to do a pilot project with the sample data before handing them the full project. They provided a sample dataset of 4000 customers across five cities on their online spend and other details.


Approach : 

- Data was imported to excel, and then normalized
- Data model was made between the required excel files using power pivot
- Pivot charts were used to present the useful data, and various insights were collected
